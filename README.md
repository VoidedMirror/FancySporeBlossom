Minecraft Fabric mod that adds a new FancySporeBlossom block into the game.

The FancySporeBlossom can be dyed any color the same as leather armour dying works in the Vanilla game, and the particle effects and block will match the dyed color.
You can also add a Glow Berry to the crafting grid with the other dyes to get a FancySporeBlossom that emits light and generates glowing particle effects.

To craft the FancySporeBlossom simply place a Vanilla Spore Blossom in any crafting grid. The default color for the FancySporeBlossom is pure White (#FFFFFF).
You can get the Vanilla Spore Blossom item back by placing the FancySporeBlossom in an empty crafting grid.

The FancySporeBlossom particle effects currently function the same as the Vanilla particle effects and are included in the the same particle group cap to maintain game performance.
